## React

To facilitate future expansion, I chose React because of its reusable component structure.\
I learned to work with React during a semester webdevelopment.

## Tailwind

This is my first project where I used Tailwind to style HTML.\
I plan to use Tailwind more often because it allows me to quickly create good looking layouts which is more enjoyable.
